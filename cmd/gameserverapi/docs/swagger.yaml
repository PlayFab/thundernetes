          the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
          meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
          owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally

          * An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)
          If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,
          it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.

          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
          provisioner.
          This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such
          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
          compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same
          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
          There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
          * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef
            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
          * While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is

          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
          remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
          exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
          resource is fully terminated.
          If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

      deletionTimestamp:
        description: |-
          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
          remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
          exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
          resource is fully terminated.
          If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

          Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.

          from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
          Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can

  v1.TopologySpreadConstraint:
    properties:
      labelSelector:
        $ref: '#/definitions/v1.LabelSelector'
        description: |-
          LabelSelector is used to find matching pods.
          Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods
          in their corresponding topology domain.
          +optional
      maxSkew:
        description: |-
          MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
          When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
          between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
          The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
          or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
          labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
          In this case, the global minimum is 1.
          +-------+-------+-------+
          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
          +-------+-------+-------+
          |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
          +-------+-------+-------+
          - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
          scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
          violate MaxSkew(1).
          - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
          When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
          to topologies that satisfy it.
          It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
        type: integer
      minDomains:
        description: |-
          MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
          When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
          Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
          And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
          this value has no effect on scheduling.
          As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
          scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
          If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
          Valid values are integers greater than 0.
          When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
          labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
          +-------+-------+-------+
          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
          +-------+-------+-------+
          |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
          +-------+-------+-------+
          The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
          In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
          because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
          it will violate MaxSkew.

          This is an alpha field and requires enabling MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate.
          +optional
        type: integer
      topologyKey:
        description: |-
          TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
          and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
          We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
          of pods into each bucket.
          We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
          Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes match the node selector.
          e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
          And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.
          It's a required field.
        type: string
      whenUnsatisfiable:
        description: |-
          WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
          the spread constraint.
          - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
          - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
            but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
            skew.
          A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
          if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
          "MaxSkew" on some topology.
          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
          labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
          +-------+-------+-------+
          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
          +-------+-------+-------+
          | P P P |   P   |   P   |
          +-------+-------+-------+
          If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
          to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
          MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
          won't make it *more* imbalanced.

          ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
          The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
          and deleted when the pod is removed.

          Use this if:
          a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
          b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
             tracking are needed,
          c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
          d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
             a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
             information on the connection between this volume type
             and PersistentVolumeClaim).

          Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific

          of an individual pod.

          Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
          be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
          more information.

      deletionTimestamp:
        description: |-
          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
          remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
          exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
          resource is fully terminated.
          If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

          Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.
          Read-only.

          Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry
          is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry
          from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.
