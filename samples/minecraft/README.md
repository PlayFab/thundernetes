# Minecraft GSDK sample for thundernetes

Check the [quickstart](https://github.com/PlayFab/thundernetes/blob/main/docs/quickstart.md) on how to run the Minecraft sample on thundernetes.

This image is based on the itzg/minecraft-server docker image, but modified to initiate the server with the GSDK wrapper, since Minecraft is not an OSS. The modified dockerfile can be found [here](https://github.com/rnjohn/docker-minecraft-server-gsdk).
