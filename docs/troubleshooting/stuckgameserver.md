# What should we do if a GameServer gets stuck? 

Sometimes the GameServer process might not responding, due to a programming bug or a misconfiguration. You can check the logs by using the command ```kubectl logs <Name>``` and running a command shell into the Pod with ```kubectl exec -it <Name> -- sh```. It might be useful to also check the NodeAgent logs for the Node that this Pod is running on, check [here](controllernodeagent.md) for more information.

If you want to delete the Pod, you can use the kubectl command ```kubectl delete gs <Name>``` since this will take down both the GameServer instance, the corresponding Pod as well as the GameServerDetail CR instance (in case the game server was allocated). 

❗ Do not directly delete the Pod. It will be deleted automatically when the GameServer is deleted.

❗ Do not manually overwrite GameServer.status details, this will create issues during controller reconciliation.
