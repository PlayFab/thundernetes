To verify the GSDK integration with your game server, you can use the LocalMultiplayerAgent utility. This utility can be found [here](https://github.com/PlayFab/MpsAgent). To use it with your game server, check the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/features/multiplayer/servers/locally-debugging-game-servers-and-integration-with-playfab#using-localmultiplayeragent-with-linux-containers).
