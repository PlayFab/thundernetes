# Thundernetes

Thundernetes makes it easy to run your game servers on Kubernetes.

> Thundernetes is a project still in development, feel free to try it and let us know of any [feedback](#feedback---community)!

## ℹ️ Description

Thundernetes is a project originating from the [Azure PlayFab Multiplayer Servers (MPS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/gaming/playfab/features/multiplayer/servers/) team and other teams in Azure/XBOX that enables you to run Linux game servers on your Kubernetes cluster. Thundernetes can be useful in the following scenarios:

- host your game servers on a Kubernetes cluster, either on a public cloud provider or on-premise and allow your users to connect from everywhere
- pre-warm game servers so that they are ready to accept players within seconds, when the game is about to start
- as part of your iterative development process, you can use Thundernetes to test your game server code
