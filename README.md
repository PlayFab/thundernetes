# Thundernetes

Thundernetes makes it easy to run your game servers on Kubernetes.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Description

Thundernetes is a project originating from the [Azure PlayFab Multiplayer Servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/gaming/playfab/features/multiplayer/servers/) team and other teams in Azure/XBOX that enables you to run both Windows and Linux game servers on your Kubernetes cluster. Thundernetes can be useful in the following scenarios:

- host your game servers on a Kubernetes cluster, either on a public cloud provider or on-premise and allow your users to connect from everywhere
- pre-warm game servers so that they are ready to accept players within seconds, when the game is about to start
- as part of your iterative development process, you can use Thundernetes locally to test your game server code

Thundernetes offers:

- game server auto-scaling, based on [requested standingBy levels](https://playfab.github.io/thundernetes/gameserverbuild.html)
- a [latency server](https://playfab.github.io/thundernetes/howtos/latencyserver.html) to test client connection to multiple Kubernetes cluster and determine the best cluster to connect to
- a [Game Server SDK](https://playfab.github.io/thundernetes/gsdk/README.html) in multiple languages/environments (Unity, Unreal, C#, C++, Java, Go) and a [local utility](https://playfab.github.io/thundernetes/gsdk/runlocalmultiplayeragent.html) to test your game server integration locally
- a [web-based User Interface](https://playfab.github.io/thundernetes/thundernetesui/README.html) to manage Thundernetes deployments in multiple clusters. This component utilizes a [REST API](https://playfab.github.io/thundernetes/gameserverapi/README.html) which you can use to manage your game servers
- an experimental [intelligent standingBy server count forecaster](https://playfab.github.io/thundernetes/howtos/intelligentscaling.html) that utilizes various algorithms to predict the number of game servers that will be needed
- [game server related Prometheus metrics and Grafana charts](https://playfab.github.io/thundernetes/howtos/monitoring.html)
